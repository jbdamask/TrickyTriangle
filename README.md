# TrickyTriangle

Working on a script to find the optimum solution to Tricky Triangle of any size

## TODO
* Extend to create a ledger of all possible ways to win a particular board configuration
* Add threads to handle solving large triangles
* Come up with different ways to choose the best move (currently random walk)
* Come up with a way to abort a game if it resembles a previously failed game (checksum for all moves at each position?)
